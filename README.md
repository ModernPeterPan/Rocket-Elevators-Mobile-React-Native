# Rocket-Elevators-Mobile-React-Native

To be able to use the project, you need to run "npm start". It should bring you to the authentication page.
I did some form validation for the authenttication page, but I did not manage to make it check through the
employee list. SO you can basically put anything and you should pass. (As long as it's longer than 3 letters)

Then you get to the home page which is unfortunatly just the get API with no CSS at all. 
I manage to put in on the website, but did'nt have time to make it look good.

Then the 3rd page exist, but there is nothing on it. Just the text Home.
